# memMatch

A Lord of the Rings themed memory match game built using object oriented programming principles. I decided to build this application to get a better understanding of object oriented programming and Sass CSS preprocessing. This game was built from the ground up using classical methodologies and includes dynamically created DOM elements and interactivity.
